## Description: 
```
There are three c++ class implementations in this subdirectory that outline the framework for a cellular automata. 
celluar_automata.cpp defines the structure of a cellular automata
rules.cpp defines how cells behave through timesteps
simulation.cpp runs the automata through timesteps
```
